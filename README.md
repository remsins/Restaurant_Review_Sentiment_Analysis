# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of restaurant reviews as positive or negative. The goal is to help restaurant owners and businesses gain valuable insights from customer feedback by analyzing large volumes of reviews.

## üöÄ Project Overview
In this project, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess, analyze, and classify restaurant reviews. The model aims to automatically determine the sentiment of a review to provide actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction.

## Key Features:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sentiment Classification</strong>: The model classifies reviews into positive or negative sentiment categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Text Preprocessing</strong>: We clean and preprocess raw text data using techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Extraction</strong>: Reviews are transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.</li>
  <li><strong>Modeling</strong>: We experiment with different machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and advanced techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.</li>
</ul>


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  <li>TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)</li>
  <li>NLTK/Spacy for NLP tasks</li>
  <li>Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation</li>
  <li>Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization</li>
</ul>


#### üìä Dataset:
We use a dataset of restaurant reviews that includes text reviews and corresponding sentiment labels (positive/negative). The dataset is cleaned and prepared for training and testing the model.

## üß† Model Workflow:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Cleaning and preparing text data.</li>
  <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Extracting meaningful features from the text.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training</strong>: Training various models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, LSTM).</li>
  <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>: Assessing model performance using test data.</li>
  <li><strong>Prediction</strong>: Classifying unseen reviews based on trained models.</li>
</ul>
